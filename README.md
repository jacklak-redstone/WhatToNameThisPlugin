ORESoft is a minigame designed to work with MiniGameCore.

# History

ORESoft (the minigame) was originally created on ORE (Open Redstone Engineers) a couple of years ago, on the /play server, hence the name.
We have turned this minigame into a plugin.

# Installation

Simply put the jar in the plugins folder of your server (you'll need to build with Gradle first). ORESoft will then add itself
to the config for available minigames, and put its world in the appropriate location. You may need to restart the server again.
